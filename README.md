# Learning Path: Machine Learning Recommendation System

## Objective
Build a recommendation system model using a combination of Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering.

## Overview
In this learning path, you'll create a powerful recommendation system that enhances user experience by providing personalized suggestions for places of interest. By blending Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering, users will receive recommendations based on their preferences and the collective insights of the community.

## Methods

### Content-Based Filtering
Utilize Content-Based Filtering to recommend places related to the user's preferences. This method analyzes the characteristics of each place and suggests similar ones, ensuring a tailored experience.

### Collaborative Filtering
Implement Collaborative Filtering to tap into the wisdom of the crowd. By considering the interactions and choices of other users with similar preferences, the system suggests popular and frequently chosen places.

## Benefits
